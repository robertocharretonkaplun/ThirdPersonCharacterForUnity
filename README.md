## How does this assets work?
This is as simple as adding the files into your project.

### Steps

2) Check that the 'Third Person Player has the script 'ThirdPersonControllerV2' as a component of the object.
3) Add the references from the animator to the 'ThirdPersonControllerV2' script.
4) Verify that your animator has the correct references for the animations.
5) Add the 'ThirdPersonCameraRotator' script as a component into your main camera or desired camera.
6) Set the reference to follow the target (the player is the target normally).
7) Adjust the camera position to follow the target in the correct way.
8) Adjust the script variables to your preference.
